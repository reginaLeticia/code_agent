Semantic Consistency Analysis: 
The commit message states "Fixed issue where onDismiss() did not get called if Snackbar is swiped." The code changes reflect this message accurately. The `dismiss()` method has been overloaded to include a boolean parameter `animate`. This allows control over the animation during dismissal, ensuring that `onDismiss()` gets called even when the Snackbar is swiped. The changes in the code are consistent with the commit message.

Security Analysis: 
The code changes are primarily related to the UI and animation of the Snackbar, and do not seem to introduce any new security vulnerabilities. The code does not involve any user input, database interactions, or network communications that could potentially lead to SQL injection, XSS, or command injection risks. It also does not involve any sensitive data or authentication/authorization processes. However, it is always recommended to keep the libraries and dependencies up-to-date to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.

Format Analysis: 
The format of the code changes aligns with the writing style and format of the original file. The code is properly indented and uses clear and descriptive variable names. The changes do not introduce any formatting inconsistencies that could impact the readability or maintainability of the project.

Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: 
The code changes are well-written and do not require any revisions. The changes accurately reflect the commit message and follow the original code's formatting style. The new `dismiss(boolean animate)` method is a good addition as it provides more control over the Snackbar's dismissal process.

Revised code: 
No revisions are necessary as the code changes are appropriate and well-written. The changes accurately address the issue described in the commit message and do not introduce any new issues or vulnerabilities.
